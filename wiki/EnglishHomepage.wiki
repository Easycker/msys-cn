=INTRODUCTION=

 * This site provides a full Minimal SYStem originally from www.mingw.org, we programmed a package management system _mpkg_ to manage and distribute packages.
 * The MSYS is compatible from user's view with Linux and UNIX development environments. Users can do Linux/UNIX shell works for educational and development purpose.

 * If you are interested providing us other tools such as packages and cross compiler support, or even interested in becoming a developer, please contact us through ways listed below.
 * If you have project or tools hosted on your space and wanted to be part of the distribution for better support, please contact us too.

 * *NOTICE: ALL binary packages supplied with this project has been compiled from their unmodified sources downloaded directly from each official site, and follows the same license as published by the author, if you need the source code you should go directly to their official site, if we have violated your rights, please contact us, we will arrange a deletion of the specified package, thanks.*

=READ FIRST=

First, you need to install following packages manually:
 # MSYS Base System : http://msys-cn.googlecode.com/files/MSYS.7z

And one of the following:
 # GCC 4 Compiler   : http://msys-cn.googlecode.com/files/mingw.7z
 # GCC 3 Compiler   : http://phoenix-system.googlecode.com/files/MingW.rar

 * *Notice*: Although gcc 4 has better optimization, it has some compatibility issues such as building the Qemu source, if you need to operate packages like this condition, you need to use gcc 3.

 Un-7z both to the same directory, execute the msys.bat then you get a working shell.

The packaging system is based on _mpkg_, the tool is written in bash shell and is still at a initial stage, not including abilities such as solving dependency issues. Though, all the packages has been compiled with statical link to reduce dependency problem.
